				<!--At least 2 field trip or work shadows that youâ€™ve participated in-->
				<p>One field trip I went to was EECS Day at UC Berkeley. In this field trip, I was toured around the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program at the university.
				I was given a tour of the facilites, including the dorms, the library, the classes, the engineering building, and much more. Here, I learned that the program was split between two
				pathways, electical engineering and computer science. While these two paths were separate, many elements of them intertwine and they shared many of the same freshman courses. Another field trip I went on was IT day at Las Positas College. This day was a competition, in which teams of three members competed in a security and electronics challenge.
				There were four scoring categories: PC building, PC presentation, Cisco network setup, and cyber security. My team placed around sixth due to our computer powering off in the cyber security
				portion, but overall it was a very fun and educational experience.</p>

				<!--At least 2 guest speakers that have provided insight into a topic of interest and gave you a real-world perspective.-->
				<p>One speaker I listened to was Otavio Good, the developer of Word Lens. During his talk, Otavio discussed his story and how he came to become a programmer. Following that, he discussed
				the growing field of artificial intelligence. Describing how different concepts in artificial intelligence worked, he explained the fundamentals and gave an insider look on the high level
				programming done by professionals. Another speaker I listened to was Greg Tietbohl, an engineering manager at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. During his talk, Greg spoke about Lawrence Livermore, describing
				the facilities and the different research they did there. He explained how they worked in a hands-on environment and had a wide range of work. In addition he discussed their team dynamic and
				lab work.</p>

				<!--Add in a 3rd paragraph describing your mentor program experiences - who was your mentor, what did you learn-->
				<p>In my junior year of high school, I was mentored by Ravi Jayasinghe, a software engineer. We began introducing each other, our hobbies, our goals, and our passions. Over time, I worked
				with Ravi more and he helped me develop lots of effective organizational skills, led me in a clear direction in terms of my goals, and taught me a lot about the job industry. Helping me
				organize my ideas into a mind map, he helped me to see clearly what I aimed to achieve throughout different time periods in my life. In addition, he helped me stay focused and working on
				activities that I enjoyed, narrowing down my interests and giving me clear insight on what industry I wanted to work with in the future. Finally, he gave me professional insight on work
				experience and job searching. Explaining what companies sought in a worker, and what pathways were effective to take in education, research programs, and job searches, Ravi created a
				walkthrough for me to settle into a stable academic and working lifestyle in the future, one step at a time.</p>
