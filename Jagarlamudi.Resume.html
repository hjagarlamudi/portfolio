				<!--At least 2 field trip or work shadows that youâ€™ve participated in-->
				<p>One field trip I went to was EECS Day at UC Berkeley. In this field trip, I was toured around the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program at the university.
				I was given a tour of the facilites, including the dorms, the library, the classes, the engineering building, and much more. Here, I learned that the program was split between two
				pathways, electical engineering and computer science. While these two paths were separate, many elements of them intertwine and they shared many of the same freshman courses.</p>
				<p>Another field trip I went on was IT day at Las Positas College. This day was a competition, in which teams of three members competed in a security and electronics challenge.
				There were four scoring categories: PC building, PC presentation, Cisco network setup, and cyber security. My team placed around sixth due to our computer powering off in the cyber security
				portion, but overall it was a very fun and educational experience.</p>
