			<div class="aboutme">
				<p>I am Harsha Jagarlamudi and I am a sophomore attending Dublin High School. My personal goal is to attain a job as a video game designer, preferrably on the programming side. To achieve this goal, I plan to learn 
				the necessary programming languages and attend a university to major in Computer Science. This is my goal because I have always desired to take part in the process behind games. I desire the feeling that I am taking 
				part in the creation of joy for many, children and adults alike.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>I am prepared for this career path because I am punctual, as shown by my near perfect attendance throughout high school so far. I am also ambitious in my learning as I strive to succeed in the more difficult courses 
				presented to me. In addition, I am organized because I allot my time according to what work I need to complete. Notable events from my high school career include my unweighted 4.0 GPA that I received throughout my freshman 
				year. I am also a secretary for the Dublin High Programming Club meaning I manage events for the benefit of the group.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>From my work experiences, I learned that I was a friendly person because I offered assistance to my peers when they desired it. I also encouraged my colleagues to work harder and boosted the group's morale. Another 
				thing I learned about myself was that I was cautious because I was never willing to take risks in my work. Overall, I am a striving student with a desire to learn. Thank you for reading about me and feel free to explore 
				the rest of my website!</p>
