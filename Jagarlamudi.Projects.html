					<p><strong>Projects:</strong> MIT App Inventor</p>
					<p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 month (December 7, 2015 - January 7, 2016)</p>
					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Select and modify an app in MIT App Inventor to create a unique project.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Team Project</p>

					<p>	For this project, we were given directions to choose a basic app and modify it.
					My partner and I chose the Get the Gold project.
					We were told to create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U6so1CYjFMy9BqdG-Rc7TPErHcYnFRVjqDCt91LRaeM/edit?usp=sharing>">Project Log</a> for this asssignment.
					We began on our beta version by modifying the code to follow the ideas we wanted.
					My partner and I managed to add a timer and a score counter.
					We also added different values for different coins and made the coins respawn.
					After that, we changed the sprites to what we wanted, made one coin manipulate time, and added comments.
					We then packaged the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1h-CQS3owyLdlZWSVBvY0s5dEk">Beta App</a>.
					We also collected the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx0T-KIWZbsHTzhvS1loNDBCaE0">Beta Source Code</a> for the beta app.
					After receiving feedback from peers we proceeded to modify our code.
					We added comments, organized code, and increased the speed of the sprite.
					We also added a background and blended the game into it.
					Finally, my partner and I downloaded the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx0T-KIWZbsHY3BPUnNKSWlzZ3M">Full App</a>.
					With the full app, we also downloaded the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx0T-KIWZbsHY3BPUnNKSWlzZ3M">Full Source Code</a> for the app.
					This project allowed me to experience working with a partner and sharing ideas.
					I also learned how to produce complex functions from simple blocks in drag and drop coding.</p>

					<p><strong>Projects:</strong> Hangman Project</p>
					<p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 5 days (March 21, 2015 - March 25, 2016)</p>
					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create and personalize a themed hangman game in Python.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Team Project</p>

					<p>For this project, my partner and I were given directions to create a themed hangman game from a blank Python page.
					In the project, I worked with my partner to create the <a href="Engineering_Portfolio/Python/Hangman/CSE4_Jagarlamudi_Gunturu_Hangman.py.txt">Source Code</a>					for the hangman game.
					I learned to collaborate better with others and incorporate numerous ideas.
					Throughout the project, I constantly rotated the roles of navigator and driver with my partner and we created a fully functional game.
					I learned to incorporate numerous functions into a single function in Python to make a working product.
					I also learned that there were a variety of ways to produce the same desired result.
					My partner and I began clueless of what to do and ended our first work day with code that did not work.
					When we worked together the next time, we produced a flawless code that displayed the well-known hangman game.
					Almost instantly, we came to the conclusion of what our theme should be and we both input numerous words to our list of items of out theme.
					We then continued to produce visual hangman art, a less complex loop, and a list clear that would allow the player to play for another time.
					Overall, we efficiently collaborated and created a product that we were both satisfied with.</p>

					<p><strong>Projects:</strong> Entrepreneurship Project</p>
					<p><strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks (May 16, 2016 - June 1, 2016)</p>
					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a unique project that directs attention and provides solutions to current issues.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Team Project</p>

					<p>For this project, my partners and I were assigned the task of creating a project that would provide solutions to current issues that were unaddressed.
					My partners and I decided to create an <a href="Engineering_Portfolio/App_Inventor/Entrepreneurship_Project/Physical_therapy2.aia">App</a> that addressed the issue we chose.
					The decision process was difficult, but we worked together to produce topics in a
					<a href="Engineering_Portfolio/App_Inventor/Entrepreneurship_Project/EntrepreneurshipProjectIdeas.docx">Brainstorming Document.</a>					Our conclusion was the Physical Therapy App which would allow anyone to easily learn about injuries, treat them on their own, and send information to their physical therapist.
					To create the prototype of our app, my partners and I first had to do <a href="Engineering_Portfolio/App_Inventor/Entrepreneurship_Project/EntrepreneurshipProjectIdeas.docx">Research</a>					on some physical injuries because we were not very well versed in the subject.
					After we learned more about the topic, we began to work on the app with MIT App Inventor.
					We created a login system and a space that collects a user's information to provide them solutions.
					We also added our research into the app so that users could access the important information.
					Following development of the app, we created a

					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Individual Project</p>

					<p>In this project, I was assigned the task of creating six different worlds with the NetLogo simulation program.
					The main problem I had in this project was working with a new programming language that I had never worked with before.
					I overcame this challenge by personally experimenting with the language to learn the different functions and syntax provided.
					To start, I received a packet with a simple guide to NetLogo.
					As time progressed, I began to learn new concepts until eventually, I felt I was fluent with the language. As a result, I created Worlds

					<p><strong>Projects:</strong> Solar and Hydrogen Vehicle</p>
					<p><strong>Course:</strong> Principles of Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks (November 2, 2016 - November 17, 2016)</p>
					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a vehicle that can run on solar or hydrogen power.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Team Project</p>

					<p>For this project, my partners and I were assigned the task of creating a vehicle capable of running on solar or hydrogen cells.
					To start, we were told to create a <a href"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jFFBNnYUIJM4FY3ad9R8LVAUKhCxwJcHyCOB1LOZFhg">Gantt Chart</a>.
					Starting off was a little bit rough, but after brainstorming, we decided to create a simple rectangular 4-wheeler design.
					A problem we came across while building was preventing the solar and hydrogen cells from falling off of the vehicle.
					We solved this problem by adding a block at the exposed edges so the cell would not slide off.
					Another problem we faced was trying to fit the cells and the breadboard all onto a narrow space.
					To fix this problem, my team created a side pocket on the vehicle to put the breadboard into.
					While we were building, we were also finishing our <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E9oJFG6CiyyCjP4-0K5QV7h2EkdNAvsGJbeJpCKXdHM">Documentation</a>.
					Through this project, my communication skills were enhanced, I had first hand experience with breadboarding, and I found more effective ways to build.</p>

					<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create an effective bridge simutation.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Team Project</p>

					<p>In this project, I was assigned the task of creating a bridge blueprint using West Point Bridge Designer simulation software.
					To start, we had to learn about various attachments and variations we could make to the bridge which would affect our total price and stability.
					After we learned this, my partner and I moved on to creating two different prototypes. I created my
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1h-CQS3owyLRnFpaDhkQndMZXM">first</a> and

					<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B99EsrheO4rjRThBSDZHQWpiTFk">second</a> design.
					After composing a decision matrix in our
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UqyejtNsHEzFqxAyCWKnrVonNnSCegk_jHXp2Ct8eVU">documentation</a>, we determined what bridge we wanted to work on the most.
					With this bridge, we made various modifications to both reduce our price and increase our stability.
					After some trial and error, we created our

						<p><strong>Projects:</strong> Printed Circuit Board</p>
						<p><strong>Course:</strong> Digital Electronics</p>
						<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks (October 5, 2018 - October 29, 2018)</p>
						<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a circuit on a PCB.</p>
						<p><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Individual Project</p>

						<p>For this project, I was assigned the task of creating a printed circuit board from scratch.
						To start, we were told to select the circuit we would create.</a>.
						Starting off was simple, and I decided to create an array of blinking seven segment displays flashing my robotics team number, 139A.
						My next task was to create a simulation, which I built using the CDS Multisim software.
						The next goal I had was to test if my circuit worked in practice on a breadboard.
						My final goal to finish this project was to print my circuit onto a copper board and etch away extra copper.
						Following this, I had to drill holes and solder the components of the circuit onto the printed board.
						Some issues I came across were on the printing process of the board.
						I found myself constrained on time when printing the physical board and ended up with some disconnected copper traces on my final board.
						While I tried to solder and drill, I found myself breaking more traces and ultimately being unable to repair them.
						As a result, my printed circuit board was not functional in the end, but I did gain some valuable experience.
						While I was working, I was also finishing my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noIUEsajjU7qf1hD27h-Y4eHP1KHmWEWxCWwyrxCZYg/edit?usp=sharing">Documentation</a>.
